# Neewer-go

Neewer-go is one trans girl's attempt at reverse engineering a Neewer SL90 RGB light and implementing a more robust and re-usable set of libraries to control it and with any luck other neewer rgb bluetooth lights. 

## Currently working:

- scanning for an SL90

## Roadmap:

- [] Connect to a light
- [] Power light on/off
- [] Read current values from light
- [] Adjust brightness/color in CCT mode
- [] Adjust Huge/Saturation/Brightness in HSI mode
- [] Activate animation modes
- [] Store presets
- [] CLI handler for controlling connected lights
